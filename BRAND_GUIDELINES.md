# newlens Brand Guidelines - The Lens DNA

This document codifies the exact physical and visual specifications for the 'newlens' hardware asset to ensure absolute consistency across all AI-generated and rendered imagery.

---

## 1. Overall Form and Proportions
- **Primary Shape:** A thick, circular optical disc (an oversized camera filter or “lens puck”).
- **Silhouette:** Perfect circle when viewed face-on.
- **Dimensions:** 
  - **Diameter:** 110mm to 140mm.
  - **Thickness:** 18mm to 28mm (substantial, solid optic).

## 2. Material and Base Colour
- **Material:** Clear optical glass or acrylic with high clarity.
- **Base Tint:** Subtle cool blue-grey tint (#BFC9D1) through the body, most visible at the rim.
- **Transparency:** High, muting and cooling the background slightly.
- **Reflections:** Strong, clean specular highlights typical of polished optical surfaces.

## 3. Edge Profile and Finishing
- **Edge Type:** Rounded, polished rim with a soft bevel.
- **Bevel/Chamfer:** Smooth transition from flat faces to sidewall (museum-grade glass paperweight finish).
- **Edge Behavior:** Acts as a light guide, producing bright bands and faint prismatic hints.

## 4. Faces (Front and Back)
- **Geometry:** Flat faces (not convex).
- **Optical Behavior:** Visible refraction/lensing due to thickness and index-of-refraction (approx 1.49 - 1.52).
- **Middle Band:** A darker, slightly curved horizontal reflection band running through the middle region.

## 5. Contact and Stance
- **Stance:** Standing upright on its edge, leaning slightly back.
- **Contact Point:** Small arc on the bottom rim. Stable and weighted.

## 6. Internal Graphics (The DNA)
- **Style:** Circuit traces and nodes (laser-etched/UV-printed appearance).
- **Logo/Emblem:** 
  - **Position:** Center-left of the disc face.
  - **Shape:** Stylised “C” or layered circular arc system.
  - **Color:** Cool teal-cyan (#39C6D6).
- **Circuitry:**
  - **Style:** Crisp lines, rounded corners, right angles.
  - **Top-left:** Thin traces meeting small circular nodes.
  - **Right Side:** A "bus" of 3-4 parallel thin lines terminating in contact dots. 
  - **Color:** Secondary greener tint (#38D98A).

## 7. Lighting Environment
- **Aesthetic:** Bright, Airy, High-key.
- **Source:** Natural sunlight (top-left specular highlight).
- **Secondary Effect:** Soft caustic/bright patch on the desk to the right of the contact point.
